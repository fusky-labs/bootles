# Bootles

A script that produces commentary-style videos in the form of [BetaEtaDelota][bootle]!

## Why?

I noticed that some of the commentary videos that has character stills with various expressions
have minimal editing. Inspired by [Lewis's Reddit Bot](https://youtu.be/3gjcY_00U1w) and
[carykh's automatic lip-sync](https://youtu.be/y3B8YqeLCpY) project, I was inevitably compelled
to make something similar to this but with character stills on them!

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that this is a personal project and also a prototype, so stuff might
> break! (90% of it might be doodoo code)

## Setup and Installation

The project uses Vite and React; you'll need a latest, preferably, LTS version higher
than 20 in Node.js and a Yarn package manager.

Install it:

```console

Run it locally:
